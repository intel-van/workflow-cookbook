# Chapter 12 · The Generate-Critique-Fix Loop (GCF)

> In one sentence: **The first draft of code almost always has blind spots, but those blind spots are usually invisible — unless you hand the code to a separate agent explicitly told to "nitpick." "Generate → Critique → Fix" has three agents take a relay: one writes, one specifically nitpicks, and one rewrites based on the nitpicks. This chapter uses a real run to show how it pushes a seemingly simple function from "it runs" to "it's robust."**
>
> This is a deceptively plain recipe with enormous leverage. It shares the same motif — **separating generation from evaluation** — with Chapter 17 (Adversarial Verification) and Chapter 14 (Judge Panel), but lands differently: adversarial verification **judges true/false**, the judge panel **picks the best**, and GCF **fixes based on the critique**. The boundaries and combinations among the three are one of this chapter's focal points.

## 12.1 Recipe Motivation: Why an Agent Can't "Check Its Own Work"

Let's start with an approach everyone has tried and almost everyone has failed at.

You ask an agent to "write a `slugify` function" and it does; offhand you follow up with "check it for bugs." It glances over and replies "looks fine, I've handled spaces, punctuation, and casing." Then you ship it, and the next day you find emoji breaking the anchors and full-width digits getting swallowed whole.

**The root of the problem isn't that the model is "not smart enough" — it's that "self-evaluation" as a task structure is inherently flawed.** The same agent just generated this code; its context is full of "here's why I wrote it this way." Asking it to scrutinize itself anchors its stance — it inclines to **defend itself** rather than **question itself**. This is the inevitable result of confirmation bias, the same pit that Chapter 17 on adversarial verification opens with.

GCF's core insight is just one sentence: **hand the critique to a fresh, independent agent and explicitly ask it to "nitpick."**

- It has an **independent context**: no baggage of "I wrote this," seeing only a piece of code to be reviewed.
- It has an **adversarial stance**: the prompt explicitly makes it a "nitpicking expert" whose success metric is "find where this code doesn't hold up."
- Its output is **structured**: a schema pins the critique into an `issues` array, rather than a "looks fine" pleasantry.

But GCF takes one crucial step beyond adversarial verification — **it doesn't stop at "find the problems," it hands them to a third agent to "fix item by item."** Adversarial verification ends with a verdict (is this a real bug); GCF ends with a **fixed artifact**. This one-step difference makes their applicable scenarios entirely distinct (see 12.5).

Hence a natural three-stage sequential pipeline:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  G["① Generate<br/>write the first draft"] --> C["② Critique<br/>independent adversarial nitpicking<br/>produces structured issues"] --> F["③ Fix<br/>rewrite per each issue"]
  style G fill:#e3f2fd
  style C fill:#fff3e0
  style F fill:#e8f5e9
```

The stages have **strict sequential dependencies**: Fix needs Critique's output (the `issues` list), Critique needs Generate's output (the first draft of code). This shape — where each stage consumes the previous stage's output — is exactly Chapter 08's `pipeline` forte; for a single target you can also chain them with plain `await` (see 12.4).

<div class="callout info">

**The difference between GCF and "self-reflection."** The popular "reflexion" / "self-refine" patterns in the community have the **same model** generate, reflect, and revise. GCF's key difference is **switching agents** — each stage is an independent `agent()` call with its own context. Per `_grounding.md`, every `agent()` in a workflow is an independent subagent, which lets GCF architecturally avoid the confirmation bias of self-evaluation, rather than hoping "the same model is more objective this time."

## 12.2 The Full Script

Below is the complete runnable form of the script used in the real run (Section 12.3). It's a minimal three-stage GCF:

```javascript
export const meta = {
  name: 'gcf-slugify',
  description: 'Generate-Critique-Fix loop producing a robust slugify (CJK + ASCII)',
  phases: [
    { title: 'Generate', detail: 'First draft' },
    { title: 'Critique', detail: 'Independent adversarial critique' },
    { title: 'Fix', detail: 'Rewrite addressing the critique' },
  ],
}

phase('Generate')
const gen = await agent(
  'Write a JavaScript function `slugify(text)` that converts a heading into a URL anchor id. ' +
  'Requirements: keep CJK characters; spaces->hyphens; strip punctuation; collapse consecutive ' +
  'hyphens; lowercase ASCII; no leading/trailing hyphen. Return only the function code.',
  { label: 'generate', schema: { type: 'object', properties: { code: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['code'] } }
)

phase('Critique')
const crit = await agent(
  `You are an adversarial code reviewer. Critique this slugify for correctness bugs and edge cases ` +
  `(empty string, all-punctuation, mixed CJK/ASCII, leading numbers, collisions, unicode). ` +
  `Be specific. Code:\n${gen.code}`,
  { label: 'critique', schema: { type: 'object', properties: { issues: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'string' } } }, required: ['issues'] } }
)

phase('Fix')
const fixed = await agent(
  `Rewrite slugify to fix every one of these issues: ${JSON.stringify(crit.issues)}. ` +
  `Original:\n${gen.code}\nReturn the final code and a one-line changelog.`,
  { label: 'fix', schema: { type: 'object', properties: { code: { type: 'string' }, changelog: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['code', 'changelog'] } }
)

log(`GCF: critique raised ${crit.issues.length} issues; fix applied`)
return { issuesFound: crit.issues, finalCode: fixed.code, changelog: fixed.changelog }
```

Reading through the intent behind **every design choice** in this script:

**`meta.phases` three stages.** The three `phase()` calls correspond to three groups on the progress tree (Chapter 05). GCF's stage names are naturally `Generate`/`Critique`/`Fix`; in the `/workflows` live progress, a reader can see at a glance "which step it's on now."

**Generate uses a minimal schema.** The first draft only needs `{ code }` — no need to over-structure, because its output is immediately handed to Critique to be torn apart. The schema's role here is to **guarantee you get a pure code string**, not narrating prose like "this is a slugify function, it..." (the schema's enforcement is in Chapter 07).

**Critique uses `issues: array` rather than free text.** This is GCF's lifeline. If Critique returns prose, the Fix stage can only revise "by feel"; whereas `issues` is a **string array**, each entry an independent, item-by-item reconcilable defect. The schema forces Critique to split "the critique" into discrete, enumerable items — which directly determines whether Fix can "fix item by item."

**Critique's prompt explicitly lists "which directions to nitpick."** The string `(empty string, all-punctuation, mixed CJK/ASCII, leading numbers, collisions, unicode)` isn't filler — it's an "attack checklist" for the adversary, guiding it to systematically cover edge cases rather than just one or two obvious ones. This echoes Chapter 17's "the adversary prompt should assign a role + guide evidence-gathering."

**Fix passes the entire `crit.issues` back + asks for a changelog.** `Rewrite slugify to fix every one of these issues: ${JSON.stringify(crit.issues)}` feeds all defects to Fix at once and demands "fix every one" — making the fix **targeted**. The extra one-line `changelog` requirement makes the fix **auditable**: you can see at a glance what it claims to have changed (echoing Chapter 17's "evidence obligation").

<div class="callout tip">

**Why does Fix receive both the "original code" and the "issues list," not just the issues?** Because Fix's job is to "fix on top of the original," not "rewrite from scratch." By passing in `gen.code` as well, Fix can preserve the **correct parts** of the first draft and touch only what's problematic — saving tokens and avoiding the regression of "fixing A while breaking the originally-correct B."

</div>

## 12.3 Real Run Results: A 30-Line Function with 10 Defects Dug Out

> **Real run**: Run ID `wf_7472ceac-daa`, Task ID `wchxy8dbm`. See `assets/transcripts/gcf-slugify.md` for the raw record.
> Real usage: `agent_count=3` ｜ `tool_uses=10` ｜ `total_tokens=96468` ｜ `duration_ms=180724` (about 3 minutes).

This was a **dogfooding** run — the output went straight into improving this book's frontend `index.html` heading-ID generation. The Generate stage produced an about-thirty-line, "looks legit" `slugify`: it handled spaces, punctuation, hyphen collapsing, and casing, and the comments even confidently marked "preserve CJK range." If you let it self-check, it would most likely say "no problem."

But the Critique stage — an independent agent explicitly asked to be "adversarial" — dug out **10 real defects**, ranked by severity:

| Severity | Defect (real, excerpted) |
|---|---|
| CRITICAL | The regex lacks the `/u` flag, matching by UTF-16 **code unit** rather than code point; `豈-﫿` is actually U+8C48..U+FAFF, **covering the surrogate-pair region 0xD800–0xDFFF** → all emoji/astral characters leak through. Measured: `slugify('I love 🍕 pizza') -> 'i-love-🍕-pizza'` |
| CRITICAL | The CJK range is written wrong/incomplete: a comment claims a full-width range `＀-￯` but actually only includes half-width katakana `ｦ-ﾟ` → `slugify('ＨＥＬＬＯ') -> ''`, `slugify('２０２４') -> ''` |
| HIGH | No NFKD normalization → precomposed `café` and decomposed `café` produce **different** slugs; `Straße -> strae` (loses ß) |
| HIGH | All non-CJK/non-Latin scripts get cleared → `slugify('Привет мир') -> ''`, Arabic → `''` |
| HIGH | Collision: `C++`/`C`/`C#` all → `c-programming` (different inputs collide on the same slug) |
| MEDIUM×3 | Non-string input leaks (`undefined -> 'undefined'`, `{} -> 'object-object'`, `[1,2,3] -> '123'`); underscores not normalized with hyphens (`'foo _ bar' -> 'foo-_-bar'`); zero-width chars (U+200B/200D/FEFF) silently fuse words (`'a​b' -> 'ab'`) |
| LOW×2 | `toLowerCase()` is locale-insensitive (Turkish İ); doesn't handle "leading digits" (illegal as an HTML id) |

The fixed version was **systematically** rewritten accordingly: it switches to the **`/u` flag** + Unicode script escapes like `\p{Script=Han}` (decisively solving both CRITICALs: the code-unit/code-point issue and the wrong range) + **NFKC** (folds full-width→ASCII) + **NFKD + stripping `\p{M}` combining marks** (unifying accent forms) + unified folding of zero-width/underscores to `-` + a non-string fallback + an optional `transliterateSymbols` (`C++` → `c-plus-plus`, resolving collisions).

<div class="callout tip">

**This is exactly the value of GCF, and the watershed between it and "self-checking."** Of these 10 defects, not one is a low-level "syntax error" you'd spot at a glance — they are all **hidden defects that only surface when you actively construct edge inputs** (emoji, full-width, combining characters, cross-script, collisions). An agent defending its own output won't construct these counterexamples; whereas an independent agent **asked to nitpick, with an attack checklist in its prompt**, systematically forces them out. This book's frontend `index.html` heading-ID generation absorbed precisely this run's lesson of "dedup + `/u` + empty-value fallback."

</div>

### Reading GCF's Cost Structure from the Usage Numbers

`agent_count=3` corresponds exactly to the script's three stages — one agent each for Generate / Critique / Fix, no concurrency. This confirms Chapter 08's rule of thumb "token ≈ agent count × per-agent context": `96468 / 3 ≈ 32K/agent`, the same order as the book's other single-agent runs (hello `wf_dacbd480-d5d` was 26,338), with Critique and Fix slightly higher because they carry "the full text of the previous stage" into context.

`duration_ms=180724` (about 3 minutes) reveals another GCF property: **the three stages are strictly serial, so wall-clock is the sum of the three segments**. This is utterly unlike the concurrent mode (Chapter 08's parallel compresses N into "the slowest one") — GCF has no concurrency, because each step must wait for the previous step's output. This is an explicit "quality for time" trade-off: you spend 3× the time of a single generation in exchange for an artifact that's been adversarially reviewed and fixed item by item.

---

## 12.4 Orchestration: await for a Single Target, pipeline for Multiple

GCF's three stages can be orchestrated two ways, depending on whether you GCF **one** target or **many**.

### Single target: chain directly with await

As in 12.2, just chain the three `agent()` calls in sequence with `await`. The control flow is plain JavaScript — `gen` → `crit` → `fixed`, each step holding the previous step's result. This is the most natural form for a "single target" scenario like one slugify, and it's the form the real run `wf_7472ceac-daa` used.

### Multiple targets: pipeline lets each GCF chain flow independently

If you want to work on **multiple** targets at once (say, running GCF on five utility functions in one go), put them into `pipeline(targets, gen, crit, fix)` — each target flows independently through the three stages, **with no barrier between stages** (Chapter 08).

```javascript
// (Illustrative, not actually run) — run GCF on multiple targets in parallel
export const meta = {
  name: 'gcf-batch',
  description: 'Run Generate-Critique-Fix on multiple targets in parallel via pipeline',
  phases: [
    { title: 'Generate', detail: 'First draft per target' },
    { title: 'Critique', detail: 'Independent adversarial critique' },
    { title: 'Fix', detail: 'Rewrite addressing the critique' },
  ],
}

const CODE = { type: 'object', properties: { code: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['code'] }
const ISSUES = { type: 'object', properties: { issues: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'string' } } }, required: ['issues'] }
const FIXED = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: { code: { type: 'string' }, changelog: { type: 'string' } },
  required: ['code', 'changelog'],
}

const targets = args.targets // e.g. ['slugify', 'debounce', 'parseQuery', ...]

const results = await pipeline(
  targets,
  // Stage 1 Generate: first draft per target
  (spec) =>
    agent(`Write a JavaScript function for: ${spec}. Return only the function code.`,
      { label: `gen:${spec}`, phase: 'Generate', schema: CODE }),
  // Stage 2 Critique: independent adversarial nitpicking
  (gen, spec) =>
    agent(
      `You are an adversarial code reviewer. Critique this implementation of "${spec}" for ` +
      `correctness bugs and edge cases. Be specific.\nCode:\n${gen.code}`,
      { label: `crit:${spec}`, phase: 'Critique', schema: ISSUES }
    ).then((crit) => ({ spec, code: gen.code, issues: crit.issues })),
  // Stage 3 Fix: fix item by item
  (prev) =>
    agent(
      `Rewrite to fix every one of these issues: ${JSON.stringify(prev.issues)}. ` +
      `Original:\n${prev.code}\nReturn final code and a one-line changelog.`,
      { label: `fix:${prev.spec}`, phase: 'Fix', schema: FIXED }
    ).then((fixed) => ({ spec: prev.spec, issuesFound: prev.issues, ...fixed }))
)

return results.filter(Boolean)
```

A few engineering details here echo the foundational hard constraints:

- **Each `agent()` explicitly passes `phase`.** Inside a pipeline, don't use a global call like `phase('Generate')`; instead pass `phase: 'Generate'` to each `agent()` — otherwise multiple targets' agents would **compete over the global `phase()`** and scramble the progress tree (`_grounding.md` explicitly recommends this).
- **Use `.then()` to "carry down" the previous stage's output.** Each pipeline stage callback receives `(prevResult, originalItem, index)`, but we often need to pass "original spec + previous-stage code + this-stage output" together to the next stage. Assembling a merged object with `.then()` is the standard technique for passing rich context down a pipeline chain (used in both Chapter 08 and Chapter 17).
- **`.filter(Boolean)` is mandatory.** A target throwing in any stage (or skipped by the user) turns that item into `null`; you must filter it out before consuming (`_grounding.md`).

<div class="callout warn">

**A pipeline's wall-clock ≈ the slowest single GCF chain, not "sum of all Generates + sum of all Critiques + sum of all Fixes."** This is the key advantage of pipeline's "no barrier between stages" (Chapter 08): while target A is still in Fix, target B may already be in Critique. But note the concurrency cap is `min(16, CPU cores − 2)` (official); agents beyond it **queue** — when the target count far exceeds the core count, wall-clock gets stretched by queuing.

## 12.5 When to Stop Iterating: The Triple Criteria of Convergence, Budget, and Round Cap

The script in 12.2 ran only **one** round of Critique→Fix. But is the artifact after Fix truly "clean"? Perhaps Fix introduced 1 new problem while fixing the 10 old ones; perhaps some defects weren't caught by Critique on the first pass. The natural thought, then, is: **put Critique→Fix in a loop and iterate until "no more problems can be picked out."**

This brings up the part of GCF that most demands engineering discipline — **when to stop**. A loop that exits only on "Critique says it's clean" is dangerous: Critique is probabilistic, it can always "invent" a seemingly-present problem and keep the loop running forever; and every round genuinely burns tokens and wall-clock. **Stopping criteria must be multiply defended** — this is the same discipline as Chapter 18's "loop-until-dry" braking:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Generate
    Generate --> Critique: first draft
    Critique --> CheckStop: issues list
    CheckStop --> Fix: issues non-empty<br/>and not capped/over-budget
    Fix --> Critique: re-nitpick (with the fixed version)
    CheckStop --> Converged: issues empty (converged)
    CheckStop --> Capped: round hits cap
    CheckStop --> Budget: budget running low
    Converged --> [*]: normal close
    Capped --> [*]: cap backstop
    Budget --> [*]: budget backstop
```

The three stopping criteria each play a role:

**Criterion 1 · Convergence — the ideal exit.** When some round's Critique returns `issues.length === 0`, the adversary can no longer pick out new problems and the artifact has converged. This is the cleanest exit. But you **must never rely on it alone** — because it may never arrive.

**Criterion 2 · Round cap — the most reliable brake.** `while (round < MAX_ROUNDS)`; no matter what Critique says, it stops at the cap. This is the simplest, most reliable seatbelt. Empirically, **3 rounds** cover the vast majority of cases: round one digs out the major defects (10 in this example), round two catches regressions introduced by Fix or escapees, and round three usually converges.

**Criterion 3 · Budget guard — the last line of defense.** Per `_grounding.md`, `budget` is a **hard cap** — calling `agent()` after `spent()` reaches `total` throws. The more proactive approach is to check `budget.remaining()` at the start of each round and close early if there isn't enough to finish a full round (Chapter 21).

Below is a runnable skeleton upgrading single-round GCF to "multi-round GCF," with all three criteria in place:

```javascript
// (Illustrative, not actually run) — multi-round GCF: convergence / round / budget triple stopping criteria
export const meta = {
  name: 'gcf-iterative',
  description: 'Iterative Generate-Critique-Fix that loops until critique converges or caps',
  phases: [
    { title: 'Generate', detail: 'First draft' },
    { title: 'Refine', detail: 'Critique→Fix until clean or capped' },
  ],
}

const MAX_ROUNDS = 3                       // Criterion 2: hard round cap
const ROUND_COST = 60_000                  // rough token estimate per round (critique+fix two agents)

phase('Generate')
let current = (await agent(
  `Write a JavaScript function for: ${args.spec}. Return only the function code.`,
  { label: 'generate', schema: { type: 'object', properties: { code: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['code'] } }
)).code

phase('Refine')
let round = 0
const history = []                         // record per-round issue counts, to audit the convergence trajectory

while (round < MAX_ROUNDS) {
  // Criterion 3: not enough budget for another round, close early
  if (budget.total !== null && budget.remaining() < ROUND_COST) {
    log(`Budget low (remaining ${budget.remaining()}); closing after round ${round}`)
    break
  }
  round++

  // Critique: independent adversarial nitpicking (carrying the current version)
  const crit = await agent(
    `You are an adversarial code reviewer. Critique this implementation of "${args.spec}" ` +
    `for correctness bugs and edge cases. Be specific. List only genuine issues.\nCode:\n${current}`,
    {
      label: `critique:r${round}`, phase: 'Refine',
      schema: { type: 'object', properties: { issues: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'string' } } }, required: ['issues'] },
    }
  )
  history.push(crit.issues.length)

  // Criterion 1: convergence — exit when nothing can be picked out
  if (crit.issues.length === 0) {
    log(`Converged at round ${round}: critique found no issues`)
    break
  }

  // Fix: fix item by item (carrying the current version + issues)
  const fixed = await agent(
    `Rewrite to fix every one of these issues: ${JSON.stringify(crit.issues)}. ` +
    `Original:\n${current}\nReturn the final code only.`,
    {
      label: `fix:r${round}`, phase: 'Refine',
      schema: { type: 'object', properties: { code: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['code'] },
    }
  )
  current = fixed.code   // next round keeps nitpicking the fixed version
}

log(`GCF iteration done: ${round} rounds, issues per round = [${history.join(', ')}]`)
return { rounds: round, issuesPerRound: history, finalCode: current }
```

<div class="callout warn">

**Never write an unbounded loop that exits only on Critique's verdict.** `while (crit.issues.length > 0)` without a round cap is GCF's most dangerous anti-pattern — Critique can almost always "pick out one more," the loop may never converge and will burn the budget dry. The global backstop `_grounding.md` provides (the per-workflow lifetime `agent()` cap of **1000**) is the last safety net, but you **must never** rely on it to terminate a business loop. The correct discipline is: **the round cap is the main brake, convergence is the ideal exit, and budget is the last line of defense — all three are required.**

</div>

<div class="callout tip">

**Diminishing returns is also a useful exit signal.** If you record `issuesPerRound` (like `history` above), you'll find it usually decays fast: `[10, 2, 0]` is a typical trajectory. If you see something **non-decaying** like `[10, 8, 9]`, it often means Critique is "picking at the same class of problems in different guises" or Fix isn't really fixing — at which point, rather than burning more rounds, it's better to stop for human intervention. Making "issue count doesn't drop for two consecutive rounds" an exit condition avoids futile iteration (echoing Chapter 18's "diminishing-returns detection").

</div>

---

## 12.6 Design Points

Distilling the preceding details into five transferable disciplines:

**① Critique must be independent and adversarial.** State clearly in the prompt "You are an adversarial code reviewer" and "Be specific," and provide an **attack checklist** (which edge directions to nitpick). It must be a **fresh `agent()` call** — independent context, with no baggage of "I just wrote this code." This is what fundamentally distinguishes GCF from "self-checking" (same source as Chapter 17).

**② The critique must be structured into an item-by-item reconcilable list.** Use a `schema` to pin the critique into `issues: array`, not free text. Being structured is the prerequisite for "fixing item by item" to land — a prose critique can only earn a prose rewrite.

**③ Fix should reconcile "item by item" and carry the original.** Fix's prompt passes the entire `crit.issues` in and demands "fix every one of these issues"; it also passes in the original code, so Fix fixes on top of the original rather than rewriting from scratch (preserving correct parts, avoiding regression). Requiring a one-line changelog makes the fix auditable.

**④ Sequential dependencies use pipeline or direct await.** For a single target, chain with `await`; for multiple targets, use `pipeline(targets, gen, crit, fix)`, letting each chain flow independently with no barrier between stages. Inside a pipeline, always pass `phase` explicitly to each `agent()` to avoid competing over the global progress group.

**⑤ Multi-round iteration must be bounded.** Convergence (issues empty) is the ideal exit, but the round cap (3 rounds empirically) is the main brake, and budget is the last line of defense. Never write an unbounded loop that exits only on Critique's verdict.

## 12.7 Differences and Combinations with Adversarial Verification and the Judge Panel

GCF, adversarial verification (Chapter 17), and the judge panel (Chapter 14) share the same motif — **separating generation from evaluation** — and beginners easily confuse them. Their essential difference lies in **"what to do after evaluation"**:

| Recipe | Evaluator's job | The evaluation's output | What to do **after** evaluation | Typical Run |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Adversarial Verification** (Ch. 17) | Refute a claim | `verdict` (confirmed/refuted/uncertain) | **Filter**: keep confirmed, discard refuted | `wf_bf086b98-6ec` |
| **Judge Panel** (Ch. 14) | Score among N candidates | each candidate's score + votes | **Pick the best**: tally votes for the winner | `wf_f5b69668-b18` (3:0) |
| **GCF** (this chapter) | Find all defects of one artifact | `issues` list | **Fix**: rewrite the artifact per the issues | `wf_7472ceac-daa` (10 defects) |

A one-line mnemonic: **adversarial verification "judges true/false," the judge panel "picks the best," GCF "fixes based on the critique."** Adversarial verification's output is a boolean/enum verdict, the judge panel's output is "which candidate wins," and GCF's output is **a fixed artifact** — only GCF "gets its hands dirty."

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph V["Adversarial Verification (Ch.17)"]
    v1["claim"] --> v2["independent refutation"] --> v3["judge: true/false"] --> v4["filter & keep"]
  end
  subgraph J["Judge Panel (Ch.14)"]
    j1["N candidates"] --> j2["multi-judge scoring"] --> j3["tally"] --> j4["pick winner"]
  end
  subgraph G["GCF (Ch.12)"]
    g1["first draft"] --> g2["independent nitpicking"] --> g3["issues list"] --> g4["rewrite per issues"]
  end
```

They're not mutually exclusive — **a truly production-grade quality gate often combines all three**. Here are several high-value combinations:

<div class="callout info">

**Combination A · GCF + a judge gatekeeps (echoing superpowers' "two-stage review")**: after Fix, add an **independent** verification agent that compares the "original issues" with the "fixed version" and confirms item by item that each issue was really fixed (rather than Fix verbally claiming it fixed something it didn't). This step is essentially adversarial verification (Chapter 17) — treating "Fix claims it's fixed" as a claim to be refuted. The superpowers system recorded in `_grounding.md` §D has exactly this "generate → fix → independently verify the fix landed" two-stage review loop as its essence.

**Combination B · judge panel picks the best → run GCF on the winner (best-of-N then refine)**: in the Generate stage, use `parallel` to produce N candidates (different angles / different samples), first use the **judge panel** (Chapter 14) to pick the single best one, then run Critique→Fix only on that winner. This enjoys the diversity of "multiple candidates" while concentrating the expensive GCF on the most promising one. This is exactly the landing point of Chapter 14's "Variant D."

**Combination C · multi-round GCF + convergent completeness check (echoing Chapter 18)**: treat 12.5's multi-round GCF as "find right + fix right," then at the end use Chapter 18's "convergent completeness check" to reconcile a known requirements checklist (spec) item by item, confirming all requirements are satisfied. GCF guarantees "written correctly," the completeness check guarantees "requirements complete" — two orthogonal quality axes.

</div>

<div class="callout tip">

**Why must "verifying the Fix landed" use an independent agent, rather than letting Fix declare it itself?** Because this returns to the self-evaluation pit — Fix just finished revising and inclines to say "all fixed." Combination A's verification agent must be an **independent** `agent()` call that receives only "original issues + fixed code" and re-judges each item for itself. This is fully consistent with Chapter 17's discipline of "the adversary receives only the conclusion + raw evidence, not the original author's reasoning."

**Variant B · A judge gatekeeps the Fix**: see Combination A — after Fix, add an independent verification agent to confirm fixes landed item by item.

**Variant C · Best-of-N then GCF**: see Combination B — Generate with `parallel` for N candidates, judge panel picks the best, then GCF the winner.

**Variant D · Layered Critique**: in the Critique stage use `parallel` to dispatch multiple critics from different angles (one for correctness, one for performance, one for security), merge their issues, then Fix uniformly — upgrading "one critic" into a "critique panel" for broader coverage (at the cost of token growing linearly with critic count).

**Variant E · Fix loop with verification**: Generate → Critique → Fix → **Verify** (independently verify the fix) → if unresolved items remain, go back to Fix — this fuses Combination A with multi-round GCF, suited to high-stakes scenarios where "it must be fixed right before shipping."

## 12.9 Chapter Summary

- **GCF = Generate → independent adversarial Critique → item-by-item Fix**, a three-stage sequential pipeline. The core is to **hand the critique to an independent agent asked to "nitpick,"** avoiding the confirmation bias of self-evaluation.
- Real run (`wf_7472ceac-daa`, 3 agents / 96,468 tokens / 180,724ms): a "looks legit" 30-line `slugify` had **10 real defects** dug out (including 2 CRITICAL), and the fixed version systematically resolves them with `/u` + Unicode scripts + NFKC/NFKD + a non-string fallback. These defects are all hidden problems that only surface when you actively construct edge inputs — self-checking can't find them.
- Key disciplines: Critique must be **independent + asked to nitpick + given an attack checklist**; the critique must be **structured into an item-by-item reconcilable issues list**; Fix must **reconcile item by item + carry the original + give a changelog**.
- Orchestration: a single target chains with `await`, multiple targets use `pipeline` to let each GCF chain flow independently (always pass `phase` explicitly, and `.filter(Boolean)` before closing).
- Triple-defended stopping criteria: **convergence** (issues empty, the ideal exit), **round cap** (3 rounds empirically, the main brake), **budget** (the last line of defense); never write an unbounded loop that exits only on Critique.
- Boundaries with neighboring chapters: **adversarial verification judges true/false, the judge panel picks the best, GCF fixes based on the critique** — only GCF "gets its hands dirty." The three can combine into a production-grade quality gate (GCF + a judge gatekeeps, best-of-N then GCF, GCF + completeness check).

The next chapter enters the "deep research" recipe: multi-source concurrent retrieval + cross-verification, to investigate an open question deeply and thoroughly.
