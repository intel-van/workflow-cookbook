## 20.1 Why Nesting Is Needed: From Copy-Paste to Reuse

Once you've written a few workflows, you'll notice some **patterns keep recurring.**

Take "adversarial verification" (Chapter 17) — generate, independently verify, three-state-verdict close-out — a structure you use in the Bug Hunter, in PR review, and in document checking too. But copy-pasting those twenty or thirty lines of `pipeline + verdictSchema` every single time is a classic bad smell:

- Improve the verification prompt, and you have to go back to every copy-paste site and sync each one by hand.
- Each call site picks up little differences, so they slowly drift apart, until nobody dares touch them.

Software engineering's standard answer to duplication is to **extract a reusable unit.** Workflow's answer is `workflow()`: settle "adversarial verification" into an independent named workflow, and have other workflows **inline-call** it when they need it, just like calling a function.

```javascript
// (illustrative, not run) — a main workflow inline-calls a verification sub-workflow
phase('Review')
const findings = await agent('Find the issues in this code…', { schema: findingsSchema })

// Call the entire "adversarial verification" sub-workflow as a function
const verified = await workflow('adversarial-verify', { claims: findings.items })

log(`Kept ${verified.confirmed.length} items after verification`)
return verified
```

The line `workflow('adversarial-verify', {...})` runs another complete workflow script (which may have its own `pipeline` and its own several `agent()` calls inside), then hands the result back as the return value. **What you reuse is no longer a snippet of code, but a validated execution unit with its own schema contract.**

<div class="callout info">

**Official semantics (per `_grounding.md` section B)**: `workflow(nameOrRef, args?): Promise<any>` — inline-run another workflow (named, or a `{scriptPath}` reference). It **shares the concurrency limit / agent count / abort signal / token budget.** And — **nesting is one level only**: calling `workflow()` again inside a sub-workflow throws. (An observability note in passing: an inline-called sub-workflow shows up in `/workflows` as a `▸ name` group, where `name` is the sub-workflow's `meta.name`, so the parent-child structure is visible at a glance.) These two properties are the heart of this chapter, expanded below.

</div>

## 20.2 Two Ways to Call: Named and scriptPath

`workflow()`'s first parameter `nameOrRef` corresponds to the two locating methods of `WorkflowInput` in `_grounding.md`:

**Way one: named workflow.** You pass a string name, and the runtime goes and finds the matching workflow — built-in, or one you've settled into `.claude/workflows/`. This is how you reuse a "solidified, repeatedly-used" workflow:

```javascript
// (illustrative, not run) — call a settled workflow by name
const result = await workflow('deep-research', { topic: args.topic })
```

**Way two: scriptPath reference.** You pass a `{ scriptPath }` object pointing to a script file on disk. This corresponds to the rule in `_grounding.md` that "`scriptPath` has higher priority than script/name," and it suits calling a script that isn't solidified into a named workflow yet but is already landed on disk:

```javascript
// (illustrative, not run) — call by script path
const result = await workflow(
  { scriptPath: '.claude/workflows/scripts/verify-stage.js' },
  { claims }
)
```

The trade-off between the two:

| Way | Suits | Analogy |
|---|---|---|
| Named `'name'` | A solidified, cross-project, standard workflow | Calling an installed library function |
| `{ scriptPath }` | An in-project, iterating, not-yet-named workflow | Calling a module by local relative path |

How the `args` parameter gets passed is the same as a top-level call: per `_grounding.md`, it becomes the global `args` inside the sub-workflow's script body. So the moment the sub-workflow reads `args.claims`, it has the value you passed in — **this is exactly the data interface between parent and child workflows.**

<div class="callout info">

**Both "args passthrough" and "an unknown named workflow throws" have been tested** (Run `wf_2b04881f-6a9`). In this probe:

- **scriptPath sub-call + args passthrough**: the parent called a child script with `workflow({ scriptPath }, { n: 21 })`, the child read `args.n` as `21` and returned `doubled: 42` — args goes **into the sub-workflow unchanged**, not stringified, not stripped of fields.
- **Unknown name throws**: call a name that doesn't exist, and the runtime will throw and **list every currently registered named workflow**, verbatim:

  ```text
  workflow('definitely-no-such-workflow-xyz'): no workflow with that name. Available: bughunt, bughunt-lite, deep-research, plan-hunter, review-branch
  ```

  This is the **same "validate + list" friendly design** as Chapter 16's unknown `agentType` throwing and listing available agents — misspell a name, and the runtime tells you right away which ones you can pick from. (The list of "available named workflows" on your machine may differ, depending on what's built in and what's installed under `.claude/workflows/`.)

</div>

```

## 20.3 The Iron Law: Nesting Is One Level Only

This is the chapter's most important constraint, and the easiest to trip over. Per `_grounding.md`: **nesting is one level only — calling `workflow()` again inside a sub-workflow throws.**

Let a diagram say it:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["main workflow (level 0)"] -->|"workflow() ✅ allowed"| B["sub-workflow (level 1)"]
    B -->|"workflow() ❌ throws"| C["grand-workflow (level 2)"]
    style C fill:#fdd,stroke:#c00
```

That is:

- **Main workflow → sub-workflow**: allowed. This is one level of nesting.
- **Sub-workflow → grand-workflow**: **forbidden**, the runtime throws.

Why this rule? You can look at it from a few angles (the exact mechanistic reason isn't expanded by the sources; the following is reasonable inference based on the constraint):

**Prevent infinite recursion and resource runaway.** If arbitrary-depth nesting were allowed, a workflow could keep calling `workflow()` forever, and combined with a loop it could blow up into an astronomical number of agents. Limiting to one level is a structural guardrail — the same "anti-runaway" philosophy as "the 1000-agent total cap per workflow" (`_grounding.md`).

**Keep the mental model simple.** One level of nesting means the call relationship is two tiers, "parent—child," and you can always see "who called whom" at a glance. Nest to any depth and tracing execution, attributing tokens, and debugging all get hard.

This rule has a direct impact on your design: **a sub-workflow must be "leaf-level" — it can fan out many `agent()`s of its own, use `pipeline` / `parallel`, but cannot delegate to yet another workflow.** So when you design a workflow library, design the workflows "that will be called by others" so they don't depend on calling other workflows.

<div class="callout warn">

**Don't try to build a multi-level pipeline out of nesting.** A common wrong idea is "I'll split the big task into three workflows A→B→C, have A call B and B call C" — that second hop (B calls C) throws directly. The right approach: **call them sequentially with ordinary JS in the main workflow**, `await workflow('B')` then `await workflow('C')`, or spread B's and C's logic across multiple stages of a `pipeline`. Nesting isn't for "deep pipelines"; it's for "the main flow reusing an independent sub-capability."

</div>

<div class="callout info">

**This book got the verbatim error of this iron law in testing** (Run `wf_2b04881f-6a9`, 0 agents / 0 tokens / 29 ms — a pure-orchestration probe, burning no model). The script had a sub-workflow call `workflow()` again, and the runtime threw, verbatim:

```text
workflow() cannot be called from within a child workflow — nesting is limited to one level. Inline the inner script or call its agents directly.
```

Note the error itself hands you two ways out, exactly matching this section's "right approach": **Inline the inner script**, or **call its agents directly**. The same run also verified two other things, see §20.2 and §20.8.

</div>

## 20.4 What Is Shared: One Pool, Not Each Its Own

A crucial property of `workflow()`: a sub-workflow is **not** a brand-new independent world; it **shares** several key resources with the parent. Per `_grounding.md`, what's shared is: **the concurrency limit, agent count, abort signal, token budget.**

Let's be clear about what each one means:

| Shared item | Meaning | What you must watch |
|---|---|---|
| **Concurrency limit** | Parent and child share the same `min(16, CPU−2)` slot pool | The sub-workflow's agents and the parent's agents compete for the same concurrency slots |
| **Agent count** | Parent's and child's agent counts combine toward the 1000 cap | The sub-workflow's fan-out consumes the parent's global quota |
| **Abort signal** | If the parent is aborted, the child is too | Cancel in one place, everything stops, no "orphan sub-processes" |
| **Token budget** | Parent and child share the same `budget` pool | The tokens the sub-workflow burns are deducted directly from the parent's `budget.remaining()` |

The one to watch most is **budget sharing.** Recall `_grounding.md`: `budget` is a **hard cap**, calling `agent()` after `spent()` reaches `total` throws, and "the pool is shared by the main loop + all workflows." This means:

```javascript
// (illustrative, not run) — the budget is the same pool shared by parent and child
phase('Pipeline')
// suppose this turn's budget.total = 500k
const a = await workflow('deep-research', { topic })   // the sub-workflow burned 300k
// now budget.remaining() has only about 200k left — the sub-workflow's consumption counts in the same pool
const b = await workflow('adversarial-verify', { claims: a.findings })  // can only run within the remaining 200k
```

If you naively assume "each sub-workflow has its own budget," you'll walk straight into the budget-exhausted throw at the second sub-workflow. **The correct mental model: nested or not, the whole turn has one token pool, one concurrency pool, one agent counter.** `workflow()` only organizes the work more modularly; it conjures up no extra resources.

<div class="callout tip">

**This is actually a good thing.** A shared pool means the `budget` cap you set in the main workflow **automatically covers** every sub-workflow it calls — you don't have to re-fortify in each one. Set the cap in one place, and the whole call tree is bound by it. Same for the abort signal: the user cancels the main flow, and all sub-flows stop cleanly together, leaving no background orphans. **The shared pool is what guarantees "overall control," not a limitation.**

</div>

---

## 20.5 The Typical Pattern: Assemble the Main Flow with Sub-Workflows

Put the preceding sections together, and look at a main workflow that assembles two independent capabilities, "research + verify."

```javascript
// (illustrative, not run) — the main flow inline-reuses two sub-workflows
export const meta = {
  name: 'research-and-verify',
  description: 'First call the research sub-workflow to produce claims, then call the verification sub-workflow to check each',
  phases: [{ title: 'Research', detail: 'call the research sub-workflow' }, { title: 'Verify', detail: 'call the verification sub-workflow' }],
}

phase('Research')
// First hop: reuse the "deep research" sub-workflow
const research = await workflow('deep-research', { topic: args.topic })
log(`Research produced ${research.claims.length} claims`)

phase('Verify')
// Second hop: sequentially call another sub-workflow in the main flow (not inside research!)
const verified = await workflow('adversarial-verify', { claims: research.claims })

return {
  topic: args.topic,
  confirmed: verified.confirmed,
  refuted: verified.refuted,
}
```

Note especially that **both hops happen in the main workflow (level 0)** — `research` and `verify` are **peer, sequential** calls, strung together by the main workflow with ordinary `await`. This is fundamentally different from "having `deep-research` internally call `adversarial-verify`" (which would trigger level-2 nesting and throw).

This is the practical corollary of §20.3's iron law: **multi-step reuse is orchestrated by the main flow's sequential/control flow, not by sub-workflows calling each other.** The main workflow is the only "orchestration layer"; the sub-workflows are all "capability units" it calls directly.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    M["main workflow (orchestration layer)"] -->|"first hop await"| R["deep-research<br/>(capability unit)"]
    R --> M
    M -->|"second hop await<br/>pass in research.claims"| V["adversarial-verify<br/>(capability unit)"]
    V --> M
    M --> O["consolidate close-out"]
```

The data flow between sub-workflows still runs through the standard channel of `args` in, `return` out: `research.claims` is the first sub-workflow's return value, fed as `args.claims` to the second. **This is of a piece with Chapter 07's "schema is the contract between stages"** — except here the "stage" is an entire sub-workflow, and the contract is its input `args` shape and output structure.

---

## 20.6 Nesting vs. Not: When You Really Need workflow()

`workflow()` is elegant, but not every "reuse" needs it. Often a plain JS function in the script is enough, or even better. Tell the two apart:

| What you want to reuse is… | Use what | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| A piece of **pure computation** logic (dedup, aggregate, format) | An ordinary JS function | Deterministic, zero agent cost, shouldn't invoke workflow |
| A **schema definition** | A `const schema = {...}` variable | Just share the object directly |
| A **fixed prompt template** | A JS function returning a string | Lightweight, no workflow overhead needed |
| A **complete capability unit with multi-agent orchestration** | `workflow()` | This is the legitimate use of nesting |
| A **solidified, cross-project** standard flow | Named `workflow('name')` | Settled into a library, like calling a third-party capability |

<div class="callout warn">

**Don't over-nest just to "look modular."** If a "sub-workflow" has only one `agent()` call inside it, it doesn't deserve to be a workflow at all — just write it as an `agent()` call in the main script, or a JS function that returns `agent(...)`. The overhead and mental cost of `workflow()` (a separate script, separate meta, cross-file tracing) only pays off when the reused unit **is itself a complete orchestration.** **The test is one question: if you didn't reuse this unit but inlined it straight into the main script, would it bloat the main script until it's hard to follow?** If yes, it's worth extracting into a sub-workflow.

</div>

---

## 20.7 The Boundary with Agent Teams

Finally, let's clear up a point people easily mix up. Workflow's `workflow()` nesting and Agent Teams (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`, see the related flag in `_grounding.md` section A) both sound like "having multiple execution units collaborate," but they are **completely different** things. Chapter 01 drew the line; here we stress it again from the "composition" angle:

| | `workflow()` nesting | Agent Teams |
|---|---|---|
| Essence | One workflow calling another (deterministic script) | A stateful, mutually communicating, long-term collaborating team |
| Control flow | Fully decided by the parent workflow's JS code | Team members negotiate dynamically via messages |
| State | Stateless, one-off, replayable | Stateful, can converse back and forth |
| Nesting | One level only | N/A (a different model) |

In short: **`workflow()` is "deterministically assembling a sub-flow into the main flow," Agent Teams is "having multiple stateful agents collaborate like a team."** When your reused unit is an "input → deterministic orchestration → output" pure flow, use `workflow()`; when what you need is dynamic, stateful back-and-forth negotiation between members, that's Agent Teams' turf, outside this book's Workflow scope.

---

## 20.8 The Signature Composition: Each Item Is Itself a Whole Workflow

§20.5 covered "the main flow sequentially assembling a few sub-workflows." Layer that on top of `pipeline` (Chapter 08), and you get the most representative shape of nested Workflows — **the parent is a `pipeline` over a batch of items, and each item is handed off to a named sub-workflow that handles it independently.**

The classic example is "review 10 PRs":

```javascript
// (illustrative, not run) parent pipeline, each PR handed to a sub-workflow handled independently
const results = await pipeline(
  prs,
  pr => workflow('review-one-pr', { pr }),   // each item is itself a whole workflow
)
```

Read this code: `prs` is the batch of PRs to review; `pipeline` lets each PR **flow through the chain independently**; and the stage on that chain isn't an `agent()` but an entire `workflow('review-one-pr', { pr })` — **each item triggers one complete sub-workflow.** Inside, `review-one-pr` can fan out its own several `agent()`s (review by dimension, adversarial verification, summarize), wrapping up the whole job of "reviewing one PR." The parent only "dispatches N PRs and collects N results"; all the complexity of how a single PR gets reviewed is tucked inside the sub-workflow.

This is exactly the endpoint shape of §20.1's "from copy-paste to reuse": **"review one PR" settles into a named capability unit, and "review a batch of PRs" is just a `pipeline` fan-out over it.** Add a PR or change the review logic, and you touch only one place.

But three constraints must always be kept in mind; all are direct corollaries of the earlier sections' iron laws under this shape:

**One, it's still only one level.** The nesting depth here is still "parent pipeline (level 0) → `review-one-pr` (level 1)" — exactly one level. So the body of `review-one-pr` **must never call `workflow()` again**: per `_grounding.md`, calling `workflow()` again inside a sub-workflow throws. `review-one-pr` must be "leaf-level" — it can fan out freely with `agent()` / `parallel` / an internal `pipeline`, but cannot delegate to yet another workflow. If you find `review-one-pr` wanting to call another sub-workflow, that's your sign to inline that logic straight into its own script, or lift it up to the parent-pipeline level to orchestrate.

**Two, all sub-workflows' agents and tokens count into the parent's same pool.** Per `_grounding.md`, `workflow()` shares the concurrency limit / agent count / abort signal / token budget (see §20.4). So under this shape, **total agent count ≈ number of PRs × the agent count inside each `review-one-pr`**, all combined toward the parent's 1000 cap and the parent's `budget` pool. Review 10 PRs with 4 agents inside each sub-workflow, and that's about 40 agents all deducting from the same budget — the scale amplifies fast, so be sure to close it out with the budget self-adaptation of Chapter 21.

**Three, a sub-workflow throwing → that item becomes `null`.** This is `pipeline`'s existing semantics (Chapter 08): if some PR's `review-one-pr` throws internally, that position becomes `null` and is skipped, without affecting the other PRs. As usual, `results.filter(Boolean)` before consuming.

<div class="callout info">

**The two properties this shape relies on both have real-run backing.** ① **The sub-workflow's agents count into the parent**: per `_grounding.md` section C, the nested workflow() run `wf_85e22b38-126` confirmed the sub-workflow's `agent_count=1` is attributed to the parent's count. ② **Nesting is one level only**: this book separately got the verbatim out-of-bounds error with `wf_2b04881f-6a9` (see §20.3) — a sub-workflow calling `workflow()` again throws `nesting is limited to one level`. This "pipeline-of-nested" composition in this section was **not run on its own** (hence the "(illustrative, not run)" mark), but all it does is drop the already-verified `workflow()` (`wf_85e22b38-126` / `wf_2b04881f-6a9`) into the equally already-verified `pipeline` (`wf_bf086b98-6ec`, see Chapter 08) — both blocks are field-tested, and the way they combine is plain JS.

## 20.9 Chapter Summary

- `workflow(nameOrRef, args?)` **inline-calls another workflow** within a workflow, treating a validated workflow as a reusable "capability unit" — the bedrock for building a workflow library.
- Two ways to locate: **named** (`'name'`, calling a solidified/cross-project standard workflow) and **`{ scriptPath }`** (calling an in-project, iterating script). `args` in, `return` out is the data interface between parent and child.
- **Iron law: nesting is one level only.** Calling `workflow()` again inside a sub-workflow throws. Multi-step reuse is orchestrated by the **main flow's sequential/control flow** (the main workflow is the only orchestration layer), not by sub-workflows calling each other.
- **Share one pool**: parent and child share the same concurrency limit, agent count (counting toward the 1000 cap), abort signal, and token budget (the `budget` hard cap applies to the whole call tree). Mental model — the whole turn has one resource pool, `workflow()` conjures up no extra resources.
- Trade-off: pure computation uses a JS function, schemas use a shared variable, prompts use a template function; only a **complete multi-agent orchestration unit** is worth extracting into `workflow()`. Don't over-nest just to "look modular."
- The signature composition (§20.8): **a parent `pipeline` fans out, and each item is itself a whole sub-workflow** (e.g., "review 10 PRs") — the endpoint shape of "reuse." It's still bound by one-level nesting (the sub-workflow can't call `workflow()` again), and all sub-workflows' agents / tokens combine into the parent's same pool.
- The boundary with Agent Teams: `workflow()` is deterministic sub-flow assembly; Agent Teams is a stateful collaborating team, outside this book's scope.

In the next chapter, we dig into the most crucial item in that recurring "shared resource pool" — the token budget: how to use `budget.total` / `remaining()` to make a workflow **dynamically adjust its scale according to the remaining budget.**
